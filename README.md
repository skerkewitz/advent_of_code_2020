# advent_of_code_2020
Code for the Advent of Code 2020 challange.

I used the Advent of Code 2020 challange to start to learn Rust. I never used Rust before, so the code looks probably like written by a neeb - because it is! Also, in the beginning I did not save my solutions because I was not planning to uploading it. So there are a few days missings or I only have the code for the second part but not for the first.

Maybe one day I will come back and clean it up - but that is a very big maybe! ;)
